# express-inventory-application
This express inventory application is a project that allowed me to test my skills with server creation, route creation, authorization implementation, database management, and my ability to work on MVC project.

The particular back-end stack for the is object is Node, Express, and MongoDB. The view engine is PUG. A variety of modules such as dotenv, passport, mongoose, and others were used as various middleware/encryption tools.

The app itself is a inventory management application for a Lego resell website. It keeps track of the inventory, allowing admins to create, delete, update, or view items in inventory. There are also normal users who can only view the items on offer.

The product, product instance, and theme are the three object models of the database.

Here is an ERD to display model attributes and relationships:
