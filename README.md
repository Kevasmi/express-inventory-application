# express-inventory-application
This express inventory application is a project that allowed me to test my skills with server creation, route creation, authorization implementation, database management, and my ability to work on MVC project.

The app itself is a management application for a Lego resell website. It keeps track of the inventory, allowing admins to create, delete, update, or view products, products instances, or kit themes.

These three items are the object models of the project.
